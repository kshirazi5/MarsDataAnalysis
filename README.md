# Mars-Challenge

We’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. We’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. We’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

This new assignment consists of two technical products. We will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
